Corner Grocer – Item Frequency Tracker
Summarize the project and what problem it was solving

This project was developed for The Corner Grocer to help analyze daily sales data and determine how frequently each produce item was purchased. The goal was to support store layout optimization by identifying high-frequency items that could be placed more strategically in the store. The program reads a text file containing a list of purchased items, counts the frequency of each, writes a backup data file (frequency.dat), and provides a menu that allows users to query individual items, print all frequencies, or display a text-based histogram.

What did you do particularly well?

I implemented an efficient and readable solution using C++ standard library features such as std::map for automatic item sorting and fast lookup. The object-oriented design—built around a FrequencyAnalyzer class—kept the logic organized, modular, and reusable. I also included robust input validation, clear inline comments, and a user-friendly menu system that prevents crashes from invalid input.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

I could enhance performance and scalability by adding file streaming for larger datasets rather than reading all input into memory at once. Additionally, converting the frequency map into a persistent database (like SQLite) could make the program more secure and scalable for future integration into point-of-sale systems. Adding exception handling for file I/O errors and validating input file integrity (for example, checking if the file is empty) would also improve fault tolerance.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

The most challenging part was ensuring input validation and menu handling worked smoothly without causing infinite loops or crashes when users entered invalid data. I overcame this by studying examples from zyBooks, reading C++ documentation on std::cin error handling, and using structured loops that reset input streams when errors occurred. I continue to rely on Stack Overflow, cplusplus.com, and my SNHU learning resources to refine best practices.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

This project strengthened my understanding of object-oriented programming (OOP), file handling, and data structures like maps, which are all highly transferable to real-world applications. The experience also reinforced best practices such as modular design, code readability, and the use of clear comments—all critical for teamwork and version control in larger software projects.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I kept the program maintainable by encapsulating functionality within a single class and using descriptive variable and function names. The code adheres to clean coding standards with consistent indentation and detailed inline comments explaining the purpose of each method. The use of constants for file names, well-defined functions, and separated logic for user interaction versus data processing makes the code easy to adapt—for instance, converting it later to read from JSON or database inputs without major redesign.
